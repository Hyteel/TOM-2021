PROBLEM Set speed for animations, animations completing at different times causes problems


Server send time to both clients
Time indicates endtime for animation
Both clients will end their animations at that time


GOOD ENOUGH SYNC





Jump
When jump animation check if touching ground, if yes then disable gravity and enable yaxis movement anim. Else do anim 0. Add this check to movement anims aswell
Each tick, check if collision above, if yes then enable gravity and set yaxis movement to 0
When anim done enable gravity
