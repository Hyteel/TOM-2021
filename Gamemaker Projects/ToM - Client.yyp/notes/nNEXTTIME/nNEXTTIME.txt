Not 100% Sync

Weak link BEGIN STEP //


Clean up properties

Input -> RecInp -> Step -> Anim
Step <- Check if Anim <- Anim 

Check if it is 5000 Time between input begin step
if not then discard input OR if it is 0 remove continous , set continous on every non zero input

Put inputs in a list with all the times
When animation is done check for the closest input that corresponds to the time
Slight delay between players in clock, might be worth checking into.

Solve it in MpHandler?


Animation done 
Check list for tht time that fits best
Do animation
Skip already passed animations
If the last one was 0 do 0 either way


Fix Animation #
Manipulate Frames OR add between frame movement #
